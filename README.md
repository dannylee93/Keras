# Keras

> This repository is about KERAS I've learned in class 



### Codes.py

Based on Keras' Tutorial, the theory was applied from the most basic Deep Learning model to gradually adding parameters. The order of the files is based on the **index number.**



### Review.md

I organized the theories according to the class I learned that day, and put them in Markdown file by referring to the theoretical books. The order of the files is based on the **DATE** when I learned.



### Practice.ipynb

Through a book written by the creator of Keras, practice examples of data sets in Keras and learn the principles of deep learning.  **- Deep Learning with Python** *Fran√ßois Chollet*
